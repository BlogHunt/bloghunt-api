<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a123501"></a>In September of last year, Evan Osnos wrote a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term?currentPage=all">piece</a> in the New Yorker that imagined what the beginning of a Trump presidency would look like. I wanted this to be the beginning of a thread in journalism, give us an idea of what we were getting into. But the focus remained on Trump's outrageousness and the Russian leaks about Hillary. We blew it. Now I'd like to see a new thread that imagines what the sequence of events might be from here-out assuming Trump stays in office and his militia grow in power and the violence escalates. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/19.html#a123501" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

For once I hope the good people of this country get out in front of the progression. At every step we've not been willing to consider how it could get worse, and do what's needed to head it off. Then it gets worse and we do it again. Right now we have a Nazi president (I don't credit him with being a "sympathizer" as some do). We still have a political system that's capable of dealing with him, but the people who have the power refuse to use it. People already have died. We have to be ready to deal with the thugs and their violence, either way. The question is can we handle having the American government leading them? One more Supreme Court appointment and we'll have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_carry_in_the_United_States">open carry</a> everywhere and you'll have to be a white male non-Jewish property owner to vote. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/19.html#a104323" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a110100"></a>God is goofing on me. After I wrote the super-serious <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/19.html#a104323">post</a> above, I dropped my Apple Watch and broke the screen. I've only broken one mobile device screen in all the years I've been using them, and after that I developed a routine to keep it from happening. Can't wear it. Too broken. Not safe. But my wrist feels totally naked without it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/19.html#a110100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm guessing most of them come from Staten Island and New Jersey, maybe some from out on the Island. Tomorrow also is the final <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml">Summer Streets</a> bike ride from 7AM to 1PM starting at Park Ave and 72nd St, through 4th Ave and onto Lafayette St, to the Brooklyn Bridge. Nazis coming by car should be aware that there will be limited cross-town access. Anyway, Summer Streets riders end up pretty close to Washington Square Park which tomorrow is Nazi-Land in NYC.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a032640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Right off the bat you know it's bullshit, because if it were a real security issue, how could they justify waiting until October?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a085700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085751"></a>Here's the story. At one time I had my own search engine because Google wasn't yet doing a great job of indexing blogs. There was a small search form on every page. The archive pages from the blog in this period, in 2006, eleven years ago, are still there. Here are <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/10.html">the</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/09.html">examples</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/07/18.html">they</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/11.html">cited</a>. The forms don't work, the search engine is long-gone. They're afraid someone will type their SSN in that form and it will be observed and recorded by an intermediary. On a decade-old archive page.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a085751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091555"></a>Don't worry. The pages aren't going anywhere and I'm not modifying them. I try to keep the archive of this blog intact and unmodified. It serves not only as record of the events on the blog, but also the technology of the blog. If you've read this site at all you'd know it was central to the development of blogging and other technologies. The blog's HTML and scripts are part of the record. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a091555" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090005"></a>I have an uncountable number of domains I have used over the years. I try to keep the sites running to the best of my ability. I've been doing this since 1994. Converting them all to HTTPS isn't going to happen unless HTTPS becomes much more manageable. And as I've explained <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+https+google+mozilla+eff&t=hy&ia=web">many times</a> here, I like storing my blog content on Amazon S3, and HTTPS and S3 are not happy partners, if you want to use your own domain name, which of course I do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090153"></a>Google will lie <i>about security</i> to accomplish a strategic objective. And a lot of people will believe them when they say <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> is a bad site. But over time, if they abuse the trust, they will lose it. That's the way this works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090153" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090254"></a>They've certainly lost me. I don't trust Google even a bit. They don't own the web, they didn't create it, and I'm not going to submit to them. If you can't read this site with Chrome, so be it. That's their choice. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I still do it. Have to. Because projects are like pies. They aren't ready for eating until they've had a chance to cool off on the counter a while. While that's happening I like to still be "there" and ready to tune things up here and there, to make things work more smoothly. And when the time feels right, go back to the pies I left on the counter a month or two ago. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">🍄</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a121358" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a111055"></a>Another shift happened a few years ago, when I decided it was okay to develop just for myself, with no intention of ever releasing the stuff I was working on. That led to a new style of product, and a happier developer. I was always doing it for myself, and fooling myself into believing it was for other people. I'm no less a narcissist than anyone else. Once you own that, you get a lot more powerful, I have found. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">🚀</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a111055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And that does not include Slack. Now look at the Activity Monitor in the Dock. Very little resource utilization. A bunch of Electron apps sitting there doing nothing doesn't use very much CPU. Here's a <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/08/17/activityMonitor.png">screen shot</a> of the Activity Monitor window. Dropbox is using 34 percent. After that, a lot of Chrome helpers and a few of the Electron apps. The most expensive is about the same as iTunes. Today's machines have lots of memory and very capable CPUs. Electron is not the issue. I'm sure some of the apps written in Electron suck, but that's not the fault of the platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a055530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The answer is yes. The same way Al Qaeda and ISIS crave publicity for their atrocities, American terrorists use publicity to drive recruitment, to grow, so the next march and uprising is bigger. More campus invasions. A clash between the First and Second Amendments. Liberal college towns: Austin, Berkeley, Madison, Ann Arbor, Boulder, Cambridge, Portland, Raleigh. Every time POTUS does a press conference and whistles loudly saying he's behind the movement, expect more deplorables to step up. The people at the marches looked like people who last year at this time were going to Trump campaign rallies. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/15.html#a101615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I use their stuff as a reference all the time for net programming. I was looking at their new <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/">tutorial</a> for Node.js and on the first page they repeat the hype about Node that I've always suspected was BS, and now that I have a few years in, I know it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015252"></a>Node is a fine environment, I use it as my main server runtime, and lately I've been <a href="http://this.how/electricRiver/">building</a> a lot with <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, and there you're using Node on the desktop. I have a love-hate relationship with Node, I'm a prisoner to some bad design imho but it's great to have one syntax instead of two for client and server apps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015424"></a>But other environments like Java and Python are probably just as efficient as Node <i>without all the crazy callbacks. </i>Their runtimes can suspend a process until its I/O completes. All the other languages/environments do that. It is not something that only Node does. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015513"></a>And Node is not single-threaded! You have many threads. A single-threaded server runtime is impossible. That's one of the reasons I strongly suspected all the hype when I was new to Node.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015513" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015554"></a>The difference between Node and other environments is that the others hide the suspending and resuming of your app behind an abstraction layer, <i>and that's good, </i>that makes your code <i>much</i> simpler. In every way imho the way JavaScript does I/O is a major step backwards. But like I said I love/hate JS. I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">made my peace</a> with the <a href="http://callbackhell.com/">way</a> I/O works in Node. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">🍑</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015554" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a124352"></a>Back in 2013 when I was getting started on Node, it was a little tricky adapting to feedparser, because the package is designed for maximum efficiency at the expense of a bit of ease-of-use, especially for a Node newbie. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a124352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

This is what I would have done. First I would have made a design tool that worked really well.

Actually two. One for my servers and one for me personally. I pay $99 per year for each. No way to avoid it. Each has a 1TB limit, but actually use less than 100GB. The servers update files a lot, so there's lots of traffic on my Dropbox account. I don't begrudge them $200 a year. They provide a lot of service for the money.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082003" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082015"></a>In early May I reprovisioned my desktop Mac because the machine was performing badly, and I couldn't figure why. So I bought a 5TB external drive, and put everything vital on it, including my Dropbox folder. That was probably a mistake. Because you can hear that drive doing its thing all the time night and day. And then the machine started getting slow. Again. Rainbow cursors. Just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY60vzAWqxw">Mac ad</a> that shows the PC going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Never-Land</a>, except it's my Mac that's doing it. Programming or writing under these circumstances is like having random <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=senior%20moment">Senior Moments</a>, which I unfortunately now have for real (I'm 62). A random computer-induced Senior Moment. Ugh. Just what I need! (Not.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082402"></a>So on Monday morning I decided it was time to move my Dropbox folder from the external drive to my unused 1TB internal drive. First there was a permissions problem. Fixed that. Then it took a good 24 hours to move the folder! All the while the computer was unusable. So I used my laptop and surprisingly got a lot of good work done. I should probably go on a trip. Anyway..<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082528"></a>Now everything's done, but Dropbox is downloading the whole folder again, for what reason exactly? As of last night it had over 600K files to download. This morning when I start work it's still got <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/08/02/dropboxSync.png">over 400K</a>. What the fuck Dropbox. What was the point of taking 24 hours to move the folder if you just have to re-download everything all over again?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082643"></a>Anyway, one of the advantages of being a senior is that I will forget all this soon enough. And because I'm a senior, I'm laughing out loud while I write this. Cackling really. This is what happens when you get old. Your mind and body fall apart but your sense of humor gets really sharp! God is merciful. Also the programming project I'm working on is truly wonderful. Open source software makes all kinds of things possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a090647"></a>I've gotten in the habit of watching two hours of GoT on Sunday night. First I watch the previous episode a second time at 8PM and then the new one at 9PM. The 8PM show was not quite as awful as I remembered. Lots of speeches as characters who had never met explain themselves.

And what about the moment when they realize that the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is really Jon Snow's auntie. Haha. They're going to do this well. They're not going to blow it.

The old Republican Party, the one Trump is splitting off of is smaller, at least for now, it seems to me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/29.html#a012415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
